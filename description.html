<br> <br>This is UHD World War II Global using the Black Elk Mega Map<br>

This is France Goes First.  This could be an alt history where you go on the offensive and act with courage in the face of German aggression. This could also result in a more historically accurate turn one with a captured France, but a strong British navy.  

Strengthen your position in Paris and make the Huns pay.  Retreat to the south and make it more secure, delaying the enemy’s eastern campaign.  Attack northern Italy, reduce a factory and destroy that valuable bomber.  Bolster the British navy in the Channel or the French fleet in the Med.  We think you will find this interesting, fresh and balanced.  We have.
